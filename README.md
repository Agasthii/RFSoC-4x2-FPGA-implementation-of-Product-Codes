# RFSoC-4x2-FPGA-implementation-of-Product-Codes

In this repository, the implementation of an eBCH(256,239,2) product code encoder and a decoder on an RFSoC4x2 FPGA board is presented. The implementation is optimized to get a low BER rate of 10<sup>-14</sup>, while achieving a high data rate of 76 Gbps. The implementation is done from scratch by implementing each and every block using Verilog.

Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques, such as block codes, and convolutional codes, make data transmission more efficient by allowing correct errors at the receiver. Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are used in many applications as an FEC technique, due to their lower complexity. The target of the project is achieving a BER of 10<sup>-14</sup> during data transmission. In this project, a high speed FPGA implementation is used to obtain such a low BER value. The FPGA implementation of product codes using extended BCH (eBCH) codes has a code rate of 0.879, and a minimum hamming distance of 36.

Random codewords are generated and fed to the eBCH (256,239) encoder, and a product code is obtained by doing both row encoding and column encoding. The encoded product code is then passed through a Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) under a defined cross-over probability. The received product code is then fed to the decoder to do iterative Bounded Distance Decoding (iBDD) using the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm. The BER of the transmission is then calculated and given as the output.

The RFSoC 4x2 board can be easily managed using the PYNQ architecture, which allows to define inputs and obtain outputs using the PYNQ interface. Vivado 2023.1 is used as the main software application for the implementation process.

### Encoding process

BCH codes are a type of block codes, which uses parity bits to encode the message codeword. BCH (255,239) codeword uses 16 parity bits to encode the 239 bit codeword, to make a 255 bit encoded codeword. After adding the extended parity bit, the minimum hamming distance of eBCH(256,239) is increased by 1. The encoding process is implemented in this design to be completed in a single clock cycle.

A single eBCH codeword can be encoded using a single encoder within a single clock cycle. In this design, 16 parallel eBCH (256,239) encoders are used to encode 16 eBCH codewords in a single clock cycle. Therefore, for a product code with k\textsubscript{1} = k\textsubscript{2} = 239, the row encoding can be done in 15 clock cycles, following the column encoding done in 16 clock cycles. For the FPGA implementation with 100 MHz clock frequency, the encoding data rate is 185 Gbps approx.

### Channel

A Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) is used as the channel, with a crossover probability that can be easily defined using the PYNQ interface.

In the FPGA implementation, LFSR blocks are used to generate a block of random noise, and 16 LFSRs' are implemented in parallel to generate 16 random noise vectors in a single clock cycle. Therefore, after each 16 clock cycles, a 256x256 noise matrix will be constructed using these noise vectors.

A product code will be encoded and passed to the channel, and the distorted product code will be fed into the decoder when required.

The implementation is done on [RFSoC 4x2](https://www.rfsoc-pynq.io/rfsoc_4x2_overview.html) FPGA board and the [PYNQ interface](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/overlay_design_methodology/overlay_tutorial.html) is used to communicate with the FPGA board in a virtual manner.
